# Compiler Design Handbook Examples

This repository contains example codes from the Compiler Design Handbook. Each example demonstrates different concepts and techniques used in compiler design and implementation.

## Contents

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Compiler
- [Example 1.1](Ex1.1.c): Program that takes a sentence as input and prints it
- [Example 1.2](Ex1.2.c): Program that takes multiple sentences as input and prints it
- [Example 1.3](Ex1.3.c): Program that counts the character numbers in a string

### Chapter 2: Phases of Compiler
- [Example 2.1](Ex2.1.c): Program that removes extra whitespace from a sentence
- [Example 2.2](Ex2.2.c): Program that removes special characters from a sentence
- [Example 2.3](Ex2.3.c): Program that counts the number of vowels and consonants in a sentence

### Chapter 3: Lexical Analysis
- [Example 3.1](Ex3.1.c): Program that checks if an input string follows the regex b*(a b* a b*)*
- [Example 3.2](Ex3.2.c): Program that checks if an email address is valid or not
- [Example 3.3](Ex3.3.c): Program to convert an NFA with 3 states and a binary alphabet to DFA

### Chapter 4: Syntax Analysis
- [Example 4.1](Ex4.1.c): Program to identify the number of single line and multiline comments in C code
- [Example 4.2](Ex4.2.c): Implementation of a predictive parser using recursive descent techniques
- [Example 4.3](Ex4.3.c): Program that calculates the FIRST set for a given context-free grammar

### Chapter 5: Intermediate Code Generation
- [Example 5.1](Ex5.2.c): Program that generates Three-Address Code (TAC) for arithmetic expressions
- [Example 5.2](Ex5.1.c): Program that validates if an arithmetic expression is a Three-Address Code (TAC) or not
- [Example 5.3](Ex5.3.c): Program that checks whether a user-entered line of code is a valid for loop header or not
  
### Chapter 6: Code Optimization and Generation
- [Example 6.1](Ex6.1.c): Implementation of Basic Block Analysis from three-address code

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler or any C compiler
- Basic understanding of C programming

### Compilation and Execution
To compile any example, use:
```bash
gcc ExampleName.c -o ExampleName
 ```


To run the compiled program:

```bash
./ExampleName
 ```
